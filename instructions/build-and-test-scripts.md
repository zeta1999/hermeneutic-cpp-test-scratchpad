- propagate last changes to run_ctest_coverage to run_local_stack_coverage, sync doc
- add vscode debug configs to run a specific unit test as compiled by run_ctest_debug.sh (possibily with a compile.debug.sh script)
 this must work with mac, linux arm64 and linux arm64, probably with different plugins, that you will document [so it could be 2,3 configs per unit test]. A demo with 2,3 unit tests is fine
