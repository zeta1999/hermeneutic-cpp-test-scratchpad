  "description": "This repository models the assignment brief with a CMake-driven C++ workspace. Three mock Central Exchanges stream BTC/USDT order book deltas over authenticated WebSockets (POCO), the aggregator consumes those feeds, maintains per-exchange books, and exposes an authenticated gRPC stream of consolidated best bid/ask data. Client services (BBO, volume bands, price bands) subscribe to that stream and publish derived metrics.",
